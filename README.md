UAM via Bastion host

User activity monitoring (UAM) helps in identiying users intentionally or accidentally misusing legitimate privileges they have been granted.
This solution makes use of various native Linux utilities installed in the bastion host to achieve that. 
Users connecting via SSH to other cli based servers (cisco, arista, F5 devices ...) will be transparently monitored through this solution
